Parse Web Logs To JSON And Avro
===============================

This pipeline demonstrates how to parse raw web logs ingested in Common Log Format and store curated data in JSON and Avro formats.

Setup And Technical Details
---------------------------

* Download the [pipeline](Parse%20Web%20Logs%20To%20JSON%20%26%20Avro.json) and import it into your Data Collector
* Update the following pipeline parameters
    * ADDED_TO_CART_FS_FOLDER
        * This is the path to the folder where you'd like Avro output file to be created
    * PAGE_VIEWS_FS_FOLDER
        * This is the path to the folder where you'd like JSON output file to be created
    * ADDED_TO_CART_FILE_PREFIX
        * This is the prefix you'd like to add to the Avro output file
    * PAGE_VIEWS_FILE_PREFIX
        * This is the prefix you'd like to add to the JSON output file


Pipeline Overview
-----------------

The pipeline has been prepopulated with sample web logs using Dev Raw Data Source origin so you don't have to worry about loading it.

![Pipeline Overview](images/img1.png)

Note that the origin's Data Format has been configured to **Log** >> **Common Log Format**. This makes it really easy to have the web logs automatically parsed. For a complete list of origins that support this and other formats, refer to the [documentation](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/latest/help/datacollector/UserGuide/Apx-DataFormats/DataFormat_Title.html#concept_kgd_11c_kv).

Pipeline Preview
----------------

Once you have updated the pipeline parameters, click on **Preview** icon to see how the data is being transformed as it is flowing through various stages in the pipeline. For details on data preview, refer to the [documentation](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/latest/help/datacollector/UserGuide/Data_Preview/DataPreview_Title.html#concept_jjk_23z_sq).


**Origin**

As shown above, the logs in Common Log Format are being read by the origin and automatically transformed into a *column/field: value* pairs of records.


**Field Type Converter**

![Field Type Converter](images/img4.png)

Using [Field Type Converter](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/latest/help/datacollector/UserGuide/Processors/FieldTypeConverter.html#concept_is3_zkp_wq) columns *response* and *timestamp* are being converted from string to integer and datetime data types respectively.


**Stream Selector**

![Stream Selector](images/img5.png)

Using [Stream Selector](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/latest/help/datacollector/UserGuide/Processors/StreamSelector.html#concept_tqv_t5r_wq) the records are conditionally routed to different paths based on condition *${str:contains(record:value("/request"), "add_to_cart")}* -- which implies that if the record column *request* (which is the HTTP request URL) contains *add_to_cart*, then we'd like to store those record in Avro format. All other records such as regular page views will be stored in JSON format.


**Schema Generator**

![Schema Generator](images/img6.png)

For the records that need to be stored in Avro format, [Schema Generator](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/latest/help/datacollector/UserGuide/Processors/SchemaGenerator.html#concept_rfz_ks3_x1b) will automatically generate schema for those records.

*Note:* You can also configure Schema Generator to cache schema so it's not calculated for every single record. For details, refer to the [documentation](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/latest/help/datacollector/UserGuide/Processors/SchemaGenerator.html#concept_rjk_y1q_1bb).


Pipeline Run
------------

Provided you've updated the pipeline parameters and there aren't any validation errors, running the pipleline should create two output files.

**Avro** -- for requests going to carts: [Sample output file](output/added-to-cart-a8a11b6c-d8fc-11ea-9149-abc78c1550f2_19aa3278-119c-4820-b11b-d58637a7b275.avro).

**JSON** -- for regular page views: [Sample output file](output/page-views-a8a11b6c-d8fc-11ea-9149-abc78c1550f2_69b93e73-ac07-45ab-b89b-90550dc14ad9.json).
